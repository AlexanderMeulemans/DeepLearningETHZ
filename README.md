# DeepLearning Project

This repository contains 6 programs all of which were used for our project:

-DCGAN: contains the program to generate new paintings according the DCGAN architecture based on https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow

-ResNet-18: contains the program to classify the painting dataset augmented with GAN generated data

-DAGAN: contains the program to generate new painints according the DAGAN architecture based on https://github.com/AntreasAntoniou/DAGAN

-DAGAN-interpolation: contains an extension of the DAGAN architecture making interpolation between classes possible as was suggested in the feedback of our proposal

-BAGAN: contains the program to generate new paintings according the BAGAN architcture based on https://github.com/IBM/BAGAN. The BAGAN architecture is also used to generate new MNIST samples

-MNIST classifier : contains the program to classify different MNIST datasets constructed from real MNIST samples and GAN generated samples from the BAGAN to improve our understanding about using gan generated data for classification tasks.
